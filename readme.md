# Building a spam classifier in R

In this project I built a spam classifier using the Naive Bayes Algorithm with final hyperparameter optimization.

The dataset used for training was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).
